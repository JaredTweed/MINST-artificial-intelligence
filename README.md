This was an assignment I did for a computer vision course CMPT412 at Simon Fraser University. My [requirements](Assignment_instructions.pdf) and [results](My_assignment_report.pdf) are in the pdfs. My results are most understandable on the last pages of my results pdf. I got full marks on this assignment.
